# Contact Page Implementation

The contact page now uses a simple, reliable approach with direct mailto links that will work universally across all browsers and platforms.

## Current Implementation

Instead of using third-party form services, the contact page uses direct email links that:

1. Open the user's default email client
2. Pre-fill the recipient (your email address)
3. Pre-fill a subject line
4. Add a template message body (for the "Let's Talk" button)

```jsx
// Simple email link example
<a href="mailto:manavpardeshi9@gmail.com?subject=Portfolio%20Inquiry">
  Send Email
</a>

// Advanced email link with pre-filled body
<a href="mailto:manavpardeshi9@gmail.com?subject=Let's%20Work%20Together&body=Hi%20Manav,%0A%0AI'm%20interested%20in%20discussing%20a%20potential%20project%20with%20you.%0A%0AProject%20Details:%0A-%20%0A-%20%0A%0ALooking%20forward%20to%20hearing%20from%20you!%0A%0ABest%20regards,">
  Let's Talk
</a>
```

## Benefits of This Approach

- **Universal Compatibility**: Works on all devices and browsers
- **No Dependencies**: Doesn't rely on third-party services that can fail
- **Zero Configuration**: No accounts or keys needed
- **Reliable**: Never breaks or returns errors
- **Privacy-Focused**: No collecting or storing of visitor data
- **Immediate Feedback**: User sees their email client open right away

## How It Works

1. When a visitor clicks "Send Email" or "Let's Talk", their default email client opens
2. The email is pre-addressed to you with an appropriate subject line
3. The visitor can personalize their message before sending
4. You receive the email directly from the visitor's email address

## Customization

To modify the email links:

1. **Update Email Address**
   - Change `manavpardeshi9@gmail.com` to your preferred email

2. **Change Subject Line**
   - Modify the `subject=Portfolio%20Inquiry` parameter
   - Note: Use `%20` instead of spaces

3. **Edit Pre-filled Message**
   - Update the `body=` parameter in the "Let's Talk" button
   - Use `%0A` for line breaks
   - Use `%20` for spaces

## Alternative Approaches

If you prefer a form-based approach in the future, consider these options:

1. **Netlify Forms**: Works automatically if deployed to Netlify
2. **Getform.io**: Simple form backend with free tier
3. **Web3Forms**: Free form submission service with no account needed

These alternatives would require modifications to the Contact.jsx component.
